Hi This is Sanjeeb from odisha, Currently working at testyantra Software Solutions  as a senior test engineer.Before coming to testyantra i was there at Arilus Technolgy pvt ltd , where I joined as a manual Test Engineer initially and After one year i switched to automation.
                                I am having a total 3 years of experience in  Testplan,Test Designning, test executiion and defect reporting and tracking.I have a great experience in tools like Automation tool-selenium webdriver, Unit Testing Tool-TestNG,Version controlTool-Github,Build Management Tool-Maven, CI/CD tool-jenkins.

             Coming to My Roles And Responsibilty,I was involved in Framework devlopment Activity,Basically I designed some of the generic libreries like BaseClass,Web driver Utilities, POM classes.

Sometimes I was helpng my team members by giving KT to them.

Whenever I got a Testcase as a automation test engineer i go through it manually to understand the flow of the test cases and also check whether the test case is automatable or not. 

When ever I got the executoon report from jenkins I always go through the report to check the test cases pass or not ,if any test case got failed i started debug it to check the root cause of the failure. 

I was involved in handling the git conflict also.Also involved in maintainning the dependencies in the POM class. Our company followed Agile Methodology an I was a prt of Scrum Team also, where I used to  attended some meetings like sprint planning meeeting- where we discuss about the planning and time consumption to complete a sprint, Daily standup Meeting and Retrospect Meeting.

My project name was 'ALtern' which is a marketing domain project. My Client is a service based company provides services like Drafting,3D- Rendering ,Interior designs.
To store all the informations, starting from marketing strategies till deliveries in a well organised way my client need a software.
                               My client followed some marketing strategies to get more customers, so to store all the marketing strategies we developed a module 
called as agitate. By useing this marketing strategies my client got some customers, so to store the details of the customers we devloped a module named as 'dominer'.
From those customers some wanted to use the services of my client we can call them as leads and to store the details of leads we developed another module named as 
'Inherent'. After this my client prepare quotations, price orders, invoice for the customers. Thats why we devloped some other modules like inventory,snippet, procure order.
              To devlop this project our company followed agile methodology and we used a hybrid framework to test the builds.In this project i was involved in testing some of the modules. I use to do functional testing to verify each and every contains of the applications according to the requirements. I used to do integretion testing to test the data transfer from module to module . Whenever  i got a stable build I do regression testing to check whether the privious defects are fixed or not and also check whether the newly changed feature impact the privously added feature.

In My framework I was using TestNG, Page Object Module, and Data Driven Tecchnology so I can say My Framework was a Hybrid Framework.
                    we used maven to develop the framework because it gives a readymade structure, and also by integrating maven we got one more advantage i.e pom.xml by useing this xml file we can download all the executable jar from maven repo at once.
                    We also integrated TestNG in my framework beacause TestNG provides multiple annotations to get a better control on the flow of execution  like @BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, @BeforeMethod,@test,@AfterMethod,@AfterClass...., It also help us to perform batch executions,parallel executions,& CrossBrowser Executions by Creating multiple Suite files.
                  We take the help of Page Object Model classes to store our elements in a encapsulated way & to write the bussiness logic also.
   We created some generic classes also to do some repetative tasks like: We created property file utility class to store the commen datas, like wise we created a excelutility class to store the test datas, we created WebDriver utilities classs where we wrote some generic methods to handle the Web elements.
